# Flat Bottom Font

A neat handwriting font. To see what it looks like click on the **Sample.pdf** file.

Some letters have a flat bottom like when you write above a ruler. This is an open source font.

This font was first created in March 2018 using an application called Glyphs Mini on a Apple Mac computer.

## Future Improvements

- Create a thicker "Bold" version of the font.
- Create a thinner "Light" version of the font.
