# Flat-Bottom-Font

This is an open source font that has been created with an application called Glyphs Mini. It is the first font that I have created, but I am very pleased with the result. This font was inspired by a friend at school who wrote an entire essay using a ruler to keep each letter exactly on the line. I started with the letter "O" which has a flat bottom, hence the name.
