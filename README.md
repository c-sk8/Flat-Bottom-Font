# Flat Bottom Font

A neat handwriting font. To see what it looks like click on the [Sample.pdf][1] file.

Some letters have a flat bottom like when you write above a ruler.

This font was made using an application called *Glyphs Mini*.

## Future Improvements

- Create a thicker "Bold" version of the font.
- Create a thinner "Light" version of the font.
